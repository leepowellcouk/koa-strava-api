# Koa.js / Strava API

This is just a bit of personal research into using Koa.js to consume the Strava API.

Nothing in this repo should be used within a production environment as it is untested and unoptimised. However, please feel free to use it for your own research purposes.

## Setting up

If you are running this on your local machine, you will need to create a `development.json` file within the `config` directory. Use this to override the `default.json` file with your own Strava Application ID, along with your API secret and token.
